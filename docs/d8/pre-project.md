#Pre-project Thoughts and Considerations

GRAB STUFF FROM PANTHEON QUARTLY REPORT

GRAB STUFF FROM OUR PRE-LAUNCH CHECKLIST


## Things to think about
* Meta-tags:
  * Where is the info coming from?
  * Is automatically populated from fields, fallback or does the user have to enter everyrthing?
  * Do you need custom tokens to get the data you need?
* Sitemap:
* Redirects:
  * How will redirects be handeled?
* Domains:
  * Will you be forcing https (YES)?
  * Will you be using www. or just the bare domain?


## Things to do
* If you are on Pantheon:
  * Enable New Relic
  * Set settings for New Relic
  * Enable New Relic Module (https://www.drupal.org/project/new_relic_rpm)
  * Enable Pantheon Advanced Page Cache module (https://www.drupal.org/project/pantheon_advanced_page_cache)
  * Setup Quicksilver
    * At the very least set it up to notify New Relic of pushes
    * (Optional) Set it up to auto import config
    * (Optional) Set it up to notify Slack
