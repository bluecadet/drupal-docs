# What PM's need to know

## Considerations for CMS driving interactives:
1. **Preview** - Does the Client need to preview content? To what extent? To simply check spelling and get an idea? Do they need to only see one 'slide' or 'state' at a time, or do they need to preview the whole app?
1. **Roles and Permissions** - Does the client need users who can only add/edit data related to the interactive?
1. Is the website driving other products (i.e. website, interactives, etc)?
